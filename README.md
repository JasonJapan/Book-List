# Book-List
A JavaScript book list

This a a JavaScript boo list for adding and deleting books on your list. It uses local storage so that your books 
will be saved so that you can access them at a later date.

Also I included two JavaScript files. one being ES5 and the other being ES6 (using this one for the book list).
